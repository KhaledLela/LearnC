Learn the C programming language from https://www.linkedin.com/learning/advanced-c-programming

Compile using:

`gcc -Wall -o program program.c`

`clang program.c -o program`

`cc program.c -o program`

`cc program.c` # a.out


Then you can run it with:

```
./program
Hello, World!
```

If your program is C++, you'll probably want to use one of these commands:
```
clang++ -o program program.cpp
g++ -std=c++11 -o program program.cpp
g++-7 -std=c++11 -o program program.cpp
```
